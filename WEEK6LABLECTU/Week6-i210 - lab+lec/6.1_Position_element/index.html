  <h1>CSS Positioning Demo</h1>
  <p>
    This page demonstrates how different <strong>CSS position values</strong> work.
    Scroll through each section carefully and observe how the colored boxes behave.
  </p>

  <!-- ====================================================
       STATIC POSITION
  ==================================================== -->
  <section class="example static-example">
    <h2>Static Position (default)</h2>
    <p>
      By default, every HTML element is <strong>static</strong>. This means it appears
      in the normal order of the page, one after another, like words in a book.
    </p>
    <div class="box static">Static Box</div>
    <p>
      Notice how the blue box above sits naturally in the page. The paragraph
      below flows right under it. Even if we try to give <code>top</code> or
      <code>left</code>, they will have <em>no effect</em> on a static element.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ====================================================
       RELATIVE POSITION
  ==================================================== -->
  <section class="example relative-example">
    <h2>Relative Position</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>relative</strong> element starts where it would normally be
      (just like static), but then we can nudge it using
      <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, or <code>bottom</code>.
    </p>
    <div class="box relative">Relative Box</div>
    <p>
      Look at the red box: it moved down and to the right. But notice something:
      the page still reserves the empty space where the box originally belonged.
      That’s why the paragraph below does not slide up to replace it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relative is like saying: “Start in your normal spot, then shift yourself
      a bit, but don’t disturb others.”
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ====================================================
       ABSOLUTE POSITION
  ==================================================== -->
  <section class="example absolute-example">
    <h2>Absolute Position</h2>
    <p>
      An <strong>absolute</strong> element is completely taken out of the
      normal page flow. It does not leave empty space behind.
    </p>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        This gray container is the <strong>ancestor</strong>.
        An ancestor simply means the outer box that contains another element.
      </p>
      <div class="box absolute">Absolute Box</div>
      <p>
        Because this container has <code>position: relative</code>, the green
        box is pinned inside it, 20px from the top and 20px from the right.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      If no ancestor has positioning set, an absolute element will pin itself
      to the entire page (<code>body</code>).
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ====================================================
       FIXED POSITION
  ==================================================== -->
  <section class="example fixed-example">
    <h2>Fixed Position</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>fixed</strong> element is pinned to the browser window
      (also called the viewport), not to the page.
    </p>
    <div class="box fixed">Fixed Box</div>
    <p>
      The yellow box will always stay at the bottom-right corner of the screen,
      even if you scroll. Try scrolling down!
    </p>
    <div style="height: 1000px;">
      <p>
        This tall block of text forces scrolling. Notice that the fixed
        yellow box does not move with the rest of the content—it is
        glued to the screen itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common uses: sticky navbars, “chat now” buttons, cookie banners,
        or floating “back to top” arrows.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- ====================================================
       Z-INDEX
  ==================================================== -->
  <section class="example zindex-example">
    <h2>Z-Index (Stacking Order)</h2>
    <p>
      When elements overlap, <strong>z-index</strong> decides which one
      appears on top. Higher numbers sit above lower numbers.
    </p>
    <div class="stack-container">
      <div class="box red">Box 1</div>
      <div class="box blue">Box 2</div>
      <div class="box green">Box 3 (on top)</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      In this example, green is above blue, and blue is above red, because
      of their <code>z-index</code> values.
    </p>

      End of demo. Quick summary:
      <br>Static = normal flow
      <br>Relative = nudge yourself
      <br>Absolute = pin to ancestor
      <br>Fixed = pin to screen
      <br>Z-index = stacking order
