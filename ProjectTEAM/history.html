        <h1>History of Pokémon</h1>
        <div class="history-content">
            <p>Pokémon is a media franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri and developed by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. It began in 1996 in Japan with the release of Pokémon Red and Green for the Game Boy. The concept was inspired by Tajiri’s childhood interest in collecting creatures and his love for nature.</p>

<p>The franchise centers around trainers capturing, training, and battling creatures called Pokémon. Each Pokémon has unique abilities, types, and evolutions, encouraging strategy and collection. The slogan “Gotta Catch ’Em All!” became iconic worldwide.</p>

After the original games, Pokémon expanded rapidly into video games, trading cards, an animated TV series, movies, toys, and merchandise, becoming one of the most successful entertainment franchises in history. By 2025, there are over 1,100 Pokémon species across multiple game generations.

Pokémon also influenced popular culture globally, fostering a massive fan community, competitive gaming, and innovations like Pokémon Go, the augmented reality mobile game released in 2016.
